  <pSince its formation in 1922, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture.[16] It is sometimes informally referred to as the Beeb or Auntie.[17][18] In 1923 it launched Radio Times (subtitled "The official organ of the BBC"), the first broadcast listings magazine; the 1988 Christmas edition sold 11 million copies, the biggest-selling edition of any British magazine in history.[19]></p>
